# ETL Status: Ready to Use!

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Created

### ETL_Control Table ‚úì
- **Status**: Created and initialized
- **Structure**: 
  - Primary Key: (TableName, Location) ‚úì
  - Columns: TableName, Location, LastProcessedTime, LastUpdated
- **Records**: 5 locations initialized
  - MTP1-01, MTP1-02, MTP1-03, ThinClient02, ThinClient03

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Still Needs to Be Created

### Stored Procedure: sp_ETL_DiagnosticToStaging_v2
**Status**: Not found - needs to be created

## üìù Next Step: Create Stored Procedure

Since I cannot execute CREATE PROCEDURE via the MCP connection, please run this in SSMS:

```sql
USE FTDIAG;
GO

-- Run the file: scripts/02_create_sp_etl_v2.sql
```

Or, you can run `scripts/00_create_complete_etl.sql` which recreates everything from scratch.

## üéØ After Creating the Stored Procedure

### 1. Run the ETL:
```sql
USE FTDIAG;
EXEC sp_ETL_DiagnosticToStaging_v2;
```

### 2. Check Results:
```sql
-- Check DiagnosticStaging
SELECT COUNT(*) AS RecordCount FROM DiagnosticStaging;
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM DiagnosticStaging ORDER BY TimeStmp DESC;

-- Check ETL_Control updated timestamps
SELECT * FROM ETL_Control WHERE TableName = 'Diagnostic' ORDER BY Location;
```

### 3. Expected Output:
```
========================================
ETL Execution Summary (v2)
========================================
Start Time: 2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX
End Time: 2025-XX-XX XX:XX:XX
Duration: XXX ms
Rows Inserted: 2
========================================
```

## üìä Current State

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| ETL_Control Table | ‚úÖ Created | 5 locations initialized |
| Stored Procedure | ‚ùå Missing | Run scripts/02_create_sp_etl_v2.sql |
| DiagnosticStaging Table | ‚úÖ Exists | Ready to receive data |
| SQL Agent Job | ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending | Create after procedure works |

## üéâ Summary

You're almost there! The hardest part (table structure and initialization) is done. Just create the stored procedure and run it.

**To complete the setup:**
1. Open `scripts/02_create_sp_etl_v2.sql` in SSMS
2. Execute it to create the stored procedure
3. Run: `EXEC sp_ETL_DiagnosticToStaging_v2`
4. Check DiagnosticStaging for results

The ETL will automatically:
- Process each location separately
- Extract only "Write" operations
- Convert True/False to 1.0/0.0
- Track latest timestamp per location
- Handle new locations automatically
